# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:
The purpose of the Election Audit was to calculate:
* total number of votes cast
* total number of votes for each candidate
* Percentage of votes for each candidate
* Generate a vote count report to determine the winner based on popular vote

We used Python to automate the process and the code will be used to audit other congressional and local elections.
