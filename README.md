# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:
The purpose of the Election Audit was to:
* Calculate the total number of votes cast
* Total number of votes for each candidate
* Percentage of votes for each candidate

We used Python to automate the process and the code will be used to audit other congressional and local elections.
